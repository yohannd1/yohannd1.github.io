# website

My current main website, generated through a little Janet static page framework I made.

For building it, see the `Makefile` or `~/.github/workflows/pages.yml`.

Extra credits:

- pyrmont's [action-janet-test](https://github.com/pyrmont/action-janet-test), which I used to run janet/jpm in the actions.
